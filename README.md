A David Bowie fan page to practice building angularJS apps. As an angularJS newb, I wanted to practice my routing - practice is usually a bit more fun when it's about something one enjoys, enter David Bowie. 


Built with AngularJs and Materialize CSS for angular. 

Special thanks to https://scotch.io/tutorials/animating-angularjs-apps-ngview for the excellent tutorial on page transitions in Angular. 

The content used on the about page is from David Bowie's actual website (which is a pretty cool).
